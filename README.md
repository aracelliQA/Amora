# Amora - Shopify app for token-gated campaigns using XRPL 

Amora is a Shopify App that allows merchants to create token-gated campaings using XLS-20 NFT to reward customers and increase loyalty. Merchants will set up their token-gated campaigns from the Shopify dashboard selecting an NFT or a group of NFTs minted in the XRPL using whatever marketplace that supports XLS-20, for example: Sologenic and XRP.CAFE. After selecting the NFTs, merchants will select the products that they want to associate to the campaign and finally, they will select the discount percetange or value for customers that have the selected NFT on their wallets.

## Tech Stack

This app combines a number of third party open-source tools:

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) builds the backend.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) builds the [React](https://reactjs.org/) frontend.
